# COVID19-Pneumonia-Normal-Disease-Classification
### Hey there, I'm Satyam 👋

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm passionate about diving into the world of machine learning and neural networks, and this project showcases one of my explorations.

🚀 **Project Overview**
In this repository, you'll find a TensorFlow and Keras implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the powerful VGG16 architecture.
The goal? To tackle an image classification task where I'm building a model to distinguish between Covid19, Pneumonia, and Normal. 

📊 **Project Highlights**
- 🧠 I leveraged the pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuning it to suit my classification needs.
- 📸 The model takes images with 3 color channels as input.
- 🛠️ The code is equipped with data augmentation to enhance model generalization.

🔍 **What's Inside**
- [x] VGG16-based model architecture defined using Keras Sequential API.
- [x] Data preprocessing using ImageDataGenerator to fuel the model.
- [x] Model training and validation with TensorFlow's fit method.

📈 **Model Performance**
After training the model, I achieved promising accuracy on the validation dataset. This project serves as a testament to my commitment to mastering neural networks and their application to real-world problems.

Feel free to explore the code and dive into the journey of building and training a CNN for image classification. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to get in touch!

Thanks for visiting and happy coding! 🌟
